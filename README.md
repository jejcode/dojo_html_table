## Dojo assignment: HTML table
# by Joel Jacobson

Pass a list of dictionaries into a flask route and render the template.

# What I learned:
Bootstrap documentation is layed out nicely so I can drop in classes and see how the elements on the page change.

Practiced using for loops to iterate through the list and generate html from data.
